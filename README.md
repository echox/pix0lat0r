This is a small animation generator for the hacklace firmware.
Currently it is under development.

Later on it should be possible to create, save and load animations for the hacklace project.
It should also be possible to write the animation directly via the serial port onto the hacklace.

Visit http://www.hacklace.org for more information of the hardware.

Features
--------
* Save/Load animations
* Export animations directly to the device via serial port
* Export animations as script
* Customizable drawer component ;-)
* Animation preview
* GUI based on SWT
